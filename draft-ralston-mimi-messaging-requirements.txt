                Requirements of Interoperable Messaging
            draft-ralston-mimi-messaging-requirements-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a set of requirements for messaging services
   to interoperate.

   These requirements are independent of any particular protocol or
   messaging service, describing the set of features an interoperable
   messaging service should support.  Services should expect to go
   beyond the requirements listed here, as MIMI's future content format
   evolves.

1.  Introduction

   MIMI's charter seeks to establish an extensible set of messaging
   features which make use of a future content format published by MIMI.
   The charter also states that MIMI will use End-to-End Encryption
   (E2EE), and that the content format must support E2EE.

   This document describes a possible set of features that messaging
   services should support.  By extension, it also includes what MIMI
   should support in its future content format.  This document also
   explores extensibility by contrasting a minimum and maximum feature
   set for interoperability over MIMI.

2.  Minimum Feature Set

   The following are the minimum features for an interoperable messaging
   service:

   *  Encryption, as required by MIMI's charter, and all associated
      features (device tracking, etc).

   *  Conversation history for search, scrollback, and filling gaps
      between messaging services.

   *  Text and rich text to represent nearly all features persisted to
      the conversation history.

   *  Ability to redact, remove, or delete a message, both as an
      individual and as a room moderator.

   *  Invite, kick, ban, and leave membership states within a
      conversation.

   *  Display names and avatars for users, to allow for personalization
      beyond their identifier or username.

   *  Direct messaging, or conversations of exactly 2 users.  The
      underlying protocol might choose to treat DMs no different from
      multi-user conversations, though messaging services might apply
      semantics to represent DMs usefully to users.

   *  Differentiation between users and their abilities.  For example,
      roles for Moderators, Admins, etc.

3.  Maximum Feature Set

   This list is not exhaustive, but outlines some examples for what the
   content format should be capable of supporting.  The features that
   messaging services currently support are:

   *  Names, topics/descriptions, and avatars for conversations for
      personalization.  Messaging services which don't support these
      aesthetic features would ignore them.

   *  Read receipts/indicators when others in the room have read the
      message.  If a messaging service doesn't support them, that
      service would not produce receipts and ignore received receipts.
      This is a safe failure mode for the feature.

   *  Typing notifications when others in the room are writing a
      message.  Like read receipts, services have the same safe failure
      mode.

   *  Presence or online state.  Like read receipts or typing
      notifications, presence has the same safe fallback mode.

   *  Images, videos, files, and audio in messages.  The content format
      would specify a fallback to (rich) text to support messaging
      services that are primarily text-based, such as by specifying a
      URL for users to click on to view the relevant media.  Voice
      messages can be represented as audio file uploads with minor
      decoration metadata in the content format.

   *  Replies (also called "rich quoting") to reference specific
      messages or parts of messages.  A content format specification
      might define a fallback format to ensure messaging services that
      do not support replies can still render something which looks
      vaguely like a reply.

   *  Threads to organize a conversation.  A content format
      specification might define a fallback to Replies to keep a
      reader's context in tact when using a messaging service that
      doesn't support threads.

   *  VoIP.  Messaging services which don't support VoIP could be asked
      to say "a call is happening, but you can't join on this device"
      under a content format, or, if the conference protocol allows, a
      link for the user to click and join the call externally.

   *  Message editing.  A content format could define a fallback which
      references the edited message with a reply and using a difference
      syntax to highlight applicable changes.

   *  Reactions.  A content format might decide to use replies to
      associate an emoji reaction with a given message, or simply as
      nothing.

   As implied above, a future content format document would be
   responsible for describing the exact details of how features fall
   back, if at all.  This document offers non-binding suggestions.

3.1.  Moderation and Personal Safety Functionality

   Currently out of scope for MIMI, moderation, anti-spam, etc
   functionality would likely be considered part of the "Maximum Feature
   Set".  A suitable protocol could support functionality such as
   ignoring or blocking individual users, "who can send invites to me"
   controls, and similar features without needing to have a specific
   content format specification necessarily.  For example, preventing
   invites from being received could simply be a rejected action over
   the delivery and transport layer.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for these features would be handled by other
   documents, such as a content format document.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
