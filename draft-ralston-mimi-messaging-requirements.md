--- abstract

This document describes a set of requirements for messengers when attempting to
interoperate with another messenger.

The requirements outlined here are intended to be independent of any particular
protocol or messenger, instead simply describing the features an interoperable
messenger should have. Messengers should be expected to go beyond the requirements
listed in this document, as is anticipated to be possible with MIMI's future content
format.
